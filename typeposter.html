    <h3>Type Poster</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a 'Typographic Poster' that would
contain the attributes of that typeface itself using only the information of
  typeface's creator, year it was created, and a set of numbers and full alphabet
  in both lowercase and uppercase with proper kerning. To create some sort of
  visual depth and also display the characteristics of some of the more unique
  letters, certain letters were used to create a background. Additionally, the
  constraints of this poster was to limit color usage to either single color,
  monochromatic, or analogous colors.</p>

First I drafted up some roughs of potential posters. Some of the explored
    a more plain style with ornamentations based on the symbols from the typeface
    itself.

  This was one of the two finals I chose. I liked this one because the background
  utilizes the full alphabet and numerals, but it's overlayed on one another to
  create a visual depth and a spotlight on the unique style of 'e' in Centaur. While
  Centaur is a "bookfont" this does feel like a very standard cover for a book,
  and it was critiqued by my peers to be boring. The final poster I ended up with
  a sense of visual depth in a less cluttered way. It's cleaner and it picks only
  a few of Centaur's more characteristic letters and spotlights those with the required
  three lines at the bottom - still within the constraints.
