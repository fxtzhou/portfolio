  <h3>Picasso Event Poster</h3>



<p>
My final project in my "Graphics and the Computer" class was to use the limited
knowledge that we learned in typography and use Photoshop and Illustrator combined
to create an Event Poster. This was initially built off of a Legacy Poster for a leader
in the arts that's no longer living, and our task was to turn it into an Event poster
based on a real or made-up event. While neither of these finals were turned in at the
  time, I went back and redid them to my liking so that it would be both true to
  the style of The Getty's event posters, but went against the assignment's requirements
to utilize Photoshop in its entirety to combine images together. </p>
