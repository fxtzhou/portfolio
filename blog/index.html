     The Dot Com Bubble </a></h2>
  <h3>October 30, 2017</h3>
<br>
<p>
  During the 'Dot Com Bubble' around 1997-2001, a lot of excessive speculation
  occurred around the Internet. It started gaining traction and people started
  to adapt and use the Internet heavily. It was also used by businesses and
  consumers. Around 2000-2002 was when a lot of companies that took part of
  utilizing the Internet failed. Big corporations we now know to be Amazon.com
  and eBay failed during this time as well, and then well-surpassed their stocks
  in a later recovery.
<br>
  Naturally, the Internet usage started to pick up due to the creation of the
  World Wide Web. Increases in Internet availability, increases of uses for the
   Internet, and increase of knowledge of the Internet naturally also led to more
    users of the Internet. Many companies and investors wanted to be a part of
    this, that is getting their company onto the web so that users could be
    exposed to their products, and naturally began to invest in ".com" sites.
    This created a stock market bubble - a huge increase in supply of these
    '.com' sites, and not a whole lot of demand at that time.
<br>
  Another reason that attributed to the bust was that these companies adopted a
  mindset of "go big or go home," or "get big fast." They started to offer their
   services or products for free in hopes that brand awareness would eventually
   allow them to charge higher rates for their products. Once they embraced this
    mentality of "growth over profits," and started to plan solely on the future
     of their products, they started to realize that a lot of their losses were
     picking up due to their offers of free or discounted products.

  <h2><a href="http://des117.space/fa2017-vizcaino/fzhou/projects/projectblog/post2.html"> Blog Research and Inspiration</a></h2>
    <h3>October 31, 2017</h3>
    <br>
  <p>
    Today I received feedback regarding my wireframe and I feel like the critiques
     I got were understandable since there’s not enough information to gather
     currently from what’s being shown.
     <br>
    I did like the responsive pop-up as an aside that would follow you depending
     on where you are in the blog post, but I realized that it’s sort of a
     ‘read more’ or ‘up next’ tactic that a lot of social media uses so I might
     get rid of that entirely.
     <br>
    I’ve decided I want to make a blog that categorizes flowers similar
    to http://www.floretflowers.com/blog/ though I’m not sure what kind of other
     content I would provide other than just different descriptions of flowers?
     Maybe the blog would just be photos with some descriptions of flowers I saw
     that day or something of that sort. Then it would look more like:
     http://www.floretflowers.com/resources/
