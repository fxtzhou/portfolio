    The Dot Com Bubble </a></h2>

  During the 'Dot Com Bubble' around 1997-2001, a lot of excessive speculation
  occurred around the Internet. It started gaining traction and people started
  to adapt and use the Internet heavily. It was also used by businesses and
  consumers. Around 2000-2002 was when a lot of companies that took part of
  utilizing the Internet failed. Big corporations we now know to be Amazon.com
  and eBay failed during this time as well, and then well-surpassed their stocks
  in a later recovery.

  Naturally, the Internet usage started to pick up due to the creation of the
  World Wide Web. Increases in Internet availability, increases of uses for the
   Internet, and increase of knowledge of the Internet naturally also led to more
    users of the Internet. Many companies and investors wanted to be a part of
    this, that is getting their company onto the web so that users could be
    exposed to their products, and naturally began to invest in ".com" sites.
    This created a stock market bubble - a huge increase in supply of these
    '.com' sites, and not a whole lot of demand at that time.

  Another reason that attributed to the bust was that these companies adopted a
  mindset of "go big or go home," or "get big fast." They started to offer their
   services or products for free in hopes that brand awareness would eventually
   allow them to charge higher rates for their products. Once they embraced this
    mentality of "growth over profits," and started to plan solely on the future
     of their products, they started to realize that a lot of their losses were
     picking up due to their offers of free or discounted products.
