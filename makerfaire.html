        <h4> Goal</h4>
        <h5>One for all</h5>
      <p>
      Queeries is
      an all-inclusive LGBTQIA+ sex forum app that creates a safe space for all genders
       and sexualities to give each other advice while promoting sexual awareness
       and education through the glossary and articles provided within the app.

      <h4>Features</h4>
    <h5>Inclusivity and Individuality</h5>
  <p>The main function of Queeries is to operate as a forum space separated out by
    categories based on different types of questions that adults tend to be 'iffy'
    about answering. Here, anything is up for discussion and the app normalizes these
    kinds of questions.</p>
    <p>One of the perks of Queeries is that your profile that you've
    customized with what your identity follows you around so that others get to know
    a little more about you as you post and discuss.</p>

    <h1>Designers of Color</h1>
<h2>
<b><a href="https://vivmokona.github.io/des157/designers_of_color/index.html" target="_blank">Designers of Color</a></b>
is an interactive platform that takes user-submitted profiles and plots them on a map to show diversity across design.</h2>



      <p>Designers of Color started off as an individual UI/UX research project for
        a capstone class at UC Davis in response to the DIS 2018 theme of diversity in design.
        Eventually, it became an ongoing collaboration project with my classmate that combined the idea of
      diversity in Design and ethnic diversity. The interactive platform utilizes MapBox
      to generate visual data for the geographic density of designers and their disciplines. When data is submitted
  through the profile form, they are populated and stored into Firebase.</p>

  <p>The entire UX process for Designers of Color can be viewed <b><a href="https://fxtzhou.github.io/des157/" target="_blank">here</a></b> under the projects tab.
    The site is best viewed in 1920x1080 as it was created for a kiosk platform. The following are the major components of the project.</p>
