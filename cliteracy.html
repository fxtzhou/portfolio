        <i>Cliteracy is project of "The Cliterates," a collective of California-based
  artists. With select installations, Cliteracy includes a wall-based installation,
  public participatory activities and salon-style events. The artist team will
  prepare and paint an entire wall with honeycomb outlines and then strategically
  prompt a public, visual conversation with their own embroidered and stitched
  hexagons of images and text. <br>

      <p>The entire exhibition could be seen outside of the Manetti Shrem Museum at UC Davis over a weekend in October.</p>

        My contributions included a popular saying within the Cliterates "Pussy Power". The ornamentation was done on an embroidery machine, and lettering handsewn. My second piece was a more <i>literal</i> statement about femininity and the importance
        of sexual health for females, but also an underlying message of how they are are perceived during their menstrual cycles - something that doesn't defy the laws of nature!
